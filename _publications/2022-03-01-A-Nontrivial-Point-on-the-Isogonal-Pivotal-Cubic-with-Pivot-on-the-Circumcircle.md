excerpt: 'It’s well-known that the nine-point center $X(5)$ and its isogonal conjugate point, Kosnita point $X(54)$, lie on the isogonal pivotal cubic $K316$ with pivot Euler reflection point $X(110)$. In this article we generalize this result to any isopivotal cubic with pivot on the circumcircle to find a nontrivial point on it.'

It’s well-known that the nine-point center $X(5)$ and its isogonal conjugate point, Kosnita point $X(54)$, lie on the isogonal pivotal cubic $K316$ with pivot Euler reflection point $X(110)$. In this article we generalize this result to any isopivotal cubic with pivot on the circumcircle to find a nontrivial point on it. This article is a joint work with Junchen Du.
