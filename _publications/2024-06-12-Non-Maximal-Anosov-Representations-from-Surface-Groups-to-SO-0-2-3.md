excerpt: 'We prove the representation given by a stable $\alpha_1$-cyclic parabolic $\mathrm{SO}_0(2,3)$-Higgs bundle through the non-Abelian Hodge correspondence is $\{\alpha_2\}$-almost dominated. This is a generalization of Filip&rsquo;s result on weight $3$ variation of Hodge structures and answers a question asked by Collier, Tholozan and Toulisse. Accepted in Mathematische Annalen.'

We prove the representation given by a stable $\alpha_1$-cyclic parabolic $\mathrm{SO}_0(2,3)$-Higgs bundle through the non-Abelian Hodge correspondence is $\{\alpha_2\}$-almost dominated. This is a generalization of Filip's result on weight $3$ variation of Hodge structures and answers a question asked by Collier, Tholozan and Toulisse. *Accepted in Mathematische Annalen, [available online](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00208-025-03249-9).*
