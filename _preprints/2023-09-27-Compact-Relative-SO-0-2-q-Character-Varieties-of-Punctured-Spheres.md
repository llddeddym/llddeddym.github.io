permalink: /preprint/2023-09-27-Compact-Relative-SO-0-2-q-Character-Varieties-of-Punctured-Spheres
excerpt: 'We prove that there are some relative $\mathrm{SO}_0(2,q)$-character varieties of the punctured sphere which are compact, totally elliptic and contain a dense representation. This work fills a remaining case of the results of N. Tholozan and J. Toulisse. Our approach relies on the utilization of the non-Abelian Hodge correspondence and we study the moduli space of parabolic $\mathrm{SO}_0(2,q)$-Higgs bundles with some fixed weight. Additionally, we provide a construction based on Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) to demonstrate that such moduli space we find can be viewed as a projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$.'

We prove that there are some relative $\mathrm{SO}_0(2,q)$-character varieties of the punctured sphere which are compact, totally elliptic and contain a dense representation. This work fills a remaining case of the results of N. Tholozan and J. Toulisse. Our approach relies on the utilization of the non-Abelian Hodge correspondence and we study the moduli space of parabolic $\mathrm{SO}_0(2,q)$-Higgs bundles with some fixed weight. Additionally, we provide a construction based on Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) to demonstrate that such moduli space we find can be viewed as a projective variety over $\mathbb{C}$. This is a joint work with Yu Feng.
